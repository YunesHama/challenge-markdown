#### You can always count on me when you need a laugh.

##### A funny story
I had an American saxophone teacher. Some day he left to go on tour. Another guy subbed for him. I walked in the smokey room and said hi not knowing I had a different teacher. At the end of the year he asked me what languages I spoke. Turned out he was Belgian and we both spoke Dutch.

###### TL:DR
I spoke English with a guy for 6 months for no reason.
